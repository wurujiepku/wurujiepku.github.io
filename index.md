# Welcome to our task!<br/>Please follow the instructions below.<br/>Don't worry, we have all your questions covered.

## All you need to do are as follows:

### 1. Take a look at two sets of images, Set A and Set B.

All the images in **Set A** can be described by the same sentence, let's denote that sentence as **C**.

However, sentence **C** is **not true** for **all** images in **Set B**. 

Therefore, even if you might have multiple sentence **C**s in mind after looking at those images in **Set A**, not all these candidates are the true sentence **C**. You need to refine your sentence **C** using images in **Set B** to ensure it satisfies the two requirements above.

The sentence **C** could be broken down into a few **"concepts"**, such as *category* (ex. dog, cat, etc.), *color* (ex. red, white, etc.), *shape* (ex. square, round, etc.), *size* (ex. small, big, etc.), *material* (ex. metal, glass, etc.), *containment* (ex. in a plate, on a table, etc.).

The concept could also be a bit complex, such as *scent*, *taste*, *nutrition*, *fragile or not*, *functionality* (ex. object that can fly, swim, etc.), *affordance* (ex. object that can be used to cut, object that can be used as a hook, etc).

### 2. Then write down the sentence **C** in your mind.

If you're really not sure about your answer, just provide your best guess! Please make sure what you write down is a **sentence**, not a few words!!

> A small bird that is flying ✅<br/>bird, fly ❌

### 3. Finally, determine whether a query image belongs to Set A or B.

This is easy! If the query image satisfies the sentence **C**, it should belong to **Set A**! Otherwise mark it as from **Set B**.

### Let's review some examples step by step:

Look at the images in two sets, *'A homeless people'* seems to be the sentence that can describe all **Set A** images while no image in **Set B** depicts it.
Therefore, sentence **C** can be *'A homeless people'*, you should write it down.
The query image clearly depicts sentence **C**, so it belongs to **Set A**.

Here we have a different query image for the previous problem, remember the sentence **C** is *'A homeless people'*, and the query image does not depict it. Therefore it belongs to **Set B**.

This problem is slightly challenging. We can see similar animals in both sets of images. However, it seems that all the animals in **Set A** are *running*, while the only running object in **Set B** is a *robot*, not an *animal*. Therefore, the sentence *'A running animal'* can describe all **Set A** images while no image in **Set B** depicts it. Let's write it down as our sentence **C**.

As for the query image, humans are biologically animals, no? So it also depicts *'A running animal'* and belongs to **Set A**.
