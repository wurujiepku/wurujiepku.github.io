# Welcome to our task! Please follow the instructions below. Don't worry, we have all your questions covered.
## All you need to do as follows
> 1.Take a look at two sets of images, Set A and Set B.

All the images in Set A can be described by the same sentence, let's denote that sentence as **C**.

However, sentence **C** is **not true** for **all** images in Set B. 

Therefore, even if you might have multiple sentence **C**s in mind after looking at those images in Set A, not all these candidates are the true sentence **C**. You need to refine your sentence **C** using images in Set B to ensure it satisfies the two requirements above.

The sentence **C** could be broken down into a few "concepts", such as category (ex. dog, cat, etc.), color (ex. red, white, etc.), shape (ex. square, round, etc.), size (ex. small, big, etc.), material (ex. metal, glass, etc.), containment (ex. in a plate, on a table, etc.).

The concept could also be a bit complex, such as scent, taste, nutrition, fragile or not, functionality (ex. object that can fly, swim, etc.), affordance (ex. object that can be used to cut, object that can be used as a hook, etc).

> 2.Then determine whether a query image belongs to Set A or B.

This is easy! If the query image satisfies the sentence **C**, it should belong to Set A! Otherwise mark it as from Set B.

> 3.Finally, write down the sentence **C** in your mind.

If you're really not sure about your answer, just provide your best guess! Please make sure what you write down is a **sentence**, not a few words!!

Ex.
> A small bird that is flying ✅

> bird, fly ❌

Let's review some examples step by step:

> ![image](assets/00_A.jpg)
  
We observe the pictures in set A and see that the Highest Common Factor of the concepts they contain is 'A homeless people'.

So you should write 'A homeless people.' into the Reason Description text box and choose set A.

> ![image](assets/00_B.jpg)

The pictures of set A and set B are the absolute same as above.

The picture of the query image is different, it looks a little like 'A homeless people', but it's a bronze statue, so you should choose set B.

> ![image](assets/01_A.jpg)

We observe the pictures in set A and see that the Highest Common Factor of the concepts they contain is 'The animal is running'.

So you should write 'The animal is running.' into the Reason Description text box and choose set A.

> ![image](assets/01_B.jpg)

The pictures of set A and set B are the absolute same as above.

The picture of the query image is different, it looks a little like 'The animal is running', but we all know kangaroos can only "jump", so you should choose set B.

> The Qualification is a simplified version of the HIT task, because you only need to choose one of the four Reason Descriptions, instead of writing it yourself.
