# Welcome to our task!<br/>Please follow the instructions below.<br/>Don't worry, we have all your questions covered.

## All you need to do are as follows:

### 1. Find pictures that satisfy each sentence.

Each HIT has 14 sentences, you need to copy them and search in **specific** image databases.

>[**Pexels**](https://www.pexels.com) & [**Flickr**](https://www.flickr.com) are preferred.✅<br/>[**GoogleImages**](https://images.google.com) is strictly prohibited.❌

Select pictures that satisfy their corresponding sentence.

+ Although the 7 sentences in the first row are the same, all pictures must be **absolutely different**.

+ And each picture in the second row cannot satisfy the sentence in the first row, i.e., **only satisfy itself**.

<!-- The **sentence** could be broken down into a few **"concepts"**, such as *category* (ex. dog, cat, etc.), *color* (ex. red, white, etc.), *shape* (ex. square, round, etc.), *size* (ex. small, big, etc.), *material* (ex. metal, glass, etc.), *containment* (ex. in a plate, on a table, etc.).

The concept could also be a bit complex, such as *scent*, *taste*, *nutrition*, *functionality* (ex. object that can fly, swim, etc.), *affordance* (ex. object that can be used to cut, drivable, etc.), *factual knowledge* (ex. US capital, etc.), *meta class* (ex. canine, rodent, etc.), *relation* (ex. A inside B, etc.), *interesting properties* (ex. rusty, broken, sharp, etc.). -->

### 2. Then paste their URLs into corresponding textbox.

Click anywhere, the corresponding image will load below. You should check whether the URL is correct.

If the URL is wrong, "IMAGE NOT FOUND" will show.

### There have some notable details:

Concepts in each sentence may contain different relationships. The import is that the concepts shown in the picture satisfy the sentence.

For example, if sentence is "animal tree", following three pictures are **all right**. There are "animal with tree" (left below), "animal on tree" (middle below), "animal in tree" (right below).

**Almost most importantly**, each picture in **2nd row** satisfy the corresponding sentence, it **must not** satisfy the sentence in **1st row**.

For example, if sentence in **1st row** is "animal tree" (left below), one sentence in **2nd row** is "hunting animal", "hunting animal by the tree" (middle below) also satisfy sentence  ("animal tree") at the same time. Instead, the right below is right for "hunting animal" (no tree).

For complex concept combinations, the picture should satisfy all concepts in sentence at the same time.

For example, if sentence in **1st row** is "a row flying birds" (left below), sentences in **2nd row** are "a row birds" (middle below) and "flying birds" (right below).
