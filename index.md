# Here Is A Simple Tutorial
## All you need to do as follows
+ Choose Set A or B to which the Query Image belongs.
+ Write the Reason description on Conceptual Difference.

**Choose Set A or B**

All the images in set A have the same concepts, while the pictures in set B contain concepts that either completely lack a certain part, and a certain part is different and contains other concepts.

> These concepts may include basic attributes, such as category (ex. dog, cat, etc.), color (ex. red, white, etc.), shape (ex. square, round, etc.), size (ex. small, big, etc.), material (ex. metal, glass, etc.), containment (ex. in a plate, on a table, etc.).

> It may also be some advanced attributes, such as scent, taste, nutrition, fragile or not, functionality (ex. fly, swim, etc.), affordance.

Choose the correct set of a query image by looking at two sets of images without any other context or information.

**Write the Reason Description**

Write down a sentence for your choice by looking at the pictures of sets A and B. This sentence describes the Highest Common Factor of concepts contained in set A pictures.

Don't be nervous, there are many fairish answers. Your thinking process is what we care about. Use your imagination and aslo please take it seriously, we will review each of your answers.

Some examples are shown below:

We observe the pictures in set A and see that the Highest Common Factor of the concepts they contain is 'A homeless people'.

So you should write 'A homeless people.' into the Reason Description text box and choose set A.

> ![image](assets/00_B.jpg)

The pictures of set A and set B are the absolute same as above.

The picture of the query image is different, it looks a little like 'A homeless people', but it's a bronze statue, so you should choose set B.

> ![image](assets/01_A.jpg)

We observe the pictures in set A and see that the Highest Common Factor of the concepts they contain is 'The animal is running'.

So you should write 'The animal is running.' into the Reason Description text box and choose set A.

> ![image](assets/01_B.jpg)

The pictures of set A and set B are the absolute same as above.

The picture of the query image is different, it looks a little like 'The animal is running', but we all know kangaroos can only "jump", so you should choose set B.

> The Qualification is a simplified version of the HIT task, because you only need to choose one of the four Reason Descriptions, instead of writing it yourself.
