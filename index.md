# Welcome to our task!<br/>Please follow the instructions below.<br/>Don't worry, we have all your questions covered.

## All you need to do are as follows:

### 1. Find pictures that satisfy each sentence.

All the images in **Set A** can be described by the same sentence, let's denote that sentence as **C**.

However, sentence **C** is **not true** for **all** images in **Set B**. 

The sentence **C** could be broken down into a few **"concepts"**, such as *category* (ex. dog, cat, etc.), *color* (ex. red, white, etc.), *shape* (ex. square, round, etc.), *size* (ex. small, big, etc.), *material* (ex. metal, glass, etc.), *containment* (ex. in a plate, on a table, etc.).

The concept could also be a bit complex, such as *scent*, *taste*, *nutrition*, *functionality* (ex. object that can fly, swim, etc.), *affordance* (ex. object that can be used to cut, drivable, etc.), *factual knowledge* (ex. US capital, etc.), *meta class* (ex. canine, rodent, etc.), *relation* (ex. A inside B, etc.), *interesting properties* (ex. rusty, broken, sharp, etc.).

In each problem, you will see one sentence **C** (same seven) and another seven sentences. You need to copy them and search in the specified database [**GettyImages**](https://www.gettyimages.com), filter pictures that satisfy each corresponding sentence, and copy their **URLs**.

### 2. Then paste their URL into the textbox.

Click anywhere, the corresponding image will load below. You can check whether the paste is correct.

If the URL is wrong, "image not found" will show.

### There have some notable details:

Concepts in each sentence may contain different relationships. The import is that the concepts shown in the picture satisfy the sentence.

For example, if sentence **C** is "animal tree", following three pictures are **all right**. There are "animal with tree", "animal on tree", "animal in tree".

**Almost most importantly**, each picture in **Set B** satisfy the corresponding sentence, it **must not** satisfy the sentence in **Set A** (i.e. sentence **C**).

For example, if sentence **C** is "animal tree" (left below), one of **Set B** sentence is "hunting animal", "hunting animal by the tree" (middle below) also satisfy sentence **C** at the same time. So the right below is right for "hunting animal".

For complex concept combinations, the picture should satisfy all concepts in sentence **C** at the same time.

For example, if sentence **C** is "a row flying birds" (right below), **Set B** sentence are "a row birds" (left below) and "flying birds" (middle below).
